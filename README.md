# Quadratic Equation Solver üìê

A simple Android application that solves quadratic equations of the form **ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0**. The app accepts the coefficients of the quadratic equation, calculates the roots, and displays the results in real-time.

---

## Features ‚ú®

- **Real-time Calculation**: Provides the roots (X1 and X2) of the quadratic equation as soon as the user inputs the coefficients.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple UI with clear instructions and results.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages when no real solution is found (when the discriminant is negative).
- **Real-Time Data Binding**: Uses Android's data binding feature for seamless updates and calculations.
- **Clear UI Design**: Utilizes Android's ConstraintLayout for a clean and responsive layout.

## App Flow üîÑ

1. **Input Coefficients**: The user enters the values of **a**, **b**, and **c** for the quadratic equation.
2. **Solve**: Upon clicking the "Solve" button, the app calculates the roots using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
3. **Display Results**: The roots are displayed on the screen. If the equation has no real roots (discriminant < 0), an error message is shown.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Android Studio**: The primary IDE for building and running the Android app.
- **Java**: The programming language used for logic and backend functionality.
- **Android Data Binding**: Used to bind the UI components to the app‚Äôs data for real-time updates.
- **ConstraintLayout**: Used for the layout design to ensure a responsive and scalable interface.

## How the Quadratic Equation Solver Works üßÆ

The app uses the quadratic formula to solve equations of the form:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

The discriminant (Œî) is calculated as:

\[
Œî = b^2 - 4ac
\]

- If **Œî > 0**, two real roots exist and are displayed.
- If **Œî = 0**, there is exactly one real root (repeated root).
- If **Œî < 0**, no real roots exist, and an error message is displayed.
